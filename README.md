# Time Series of stocks

The historical data of stock prices for four stocks is taken from the [Yahoo Finance Api](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/yahoo-finance1) through HTTP GET request.

This data is then combined and transformed to a csv file

Using open source projects Dash and Plotly a reactive, web-based dashboard is created.

For more information, see [Time Series Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/time-series/).

## Getting Started
